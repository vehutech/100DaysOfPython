# 🚀 100 Days of Python 🐍

Welcome to the **100 Days of Python** coding challenge! This initiative is designed to take you from beginner to expert in Python programming through disciplined, structured learning and hands-on projects.

## 📌 About This Challenge
This challenge is not just about writing Python code daily—it’s about **mastering Python deeply**. We’ll explore:
- In-depth Python concepts and abstractions beyond just using libraries.
- Zen programming: writing clean, efficient, and scalable code.
- Full-stack Python development (backend & frontend).
- AI and machine learning model building.
- A final project: **building an image recognition application**.

## 🔥 What You’ll Learn
Each day, we’ll tackle new topics, building from fundamentals to advanced concepts, including:
- Python Core (Syntax, Data Structures, OOP)
- Algorithm Design & Problem Solving
- Django for Backend Development
- Frontend with Python Tools
- AI & Machine Learning
- Deep Learning & Image Recognition

We’ll be using **Django** (instead of Flask/FastAPI) and **MySQL** as our database of choice.

## 📚 Learning Resources
We’ll be leveraging high-quality books, videos, and the **Harvard CS50 course** and quite a handfull of others as our foundation.

## 🎯 How to Participate
1. **Fork this repository** and clone it to your local machine.
2. Create a new folder for each day (e.g., `Day_01`).
3. Solve the challenge for the day and push your work.
4. Engage with others on our [**[Discord Server](#)**](https://discord.gg/FYbKuRGu).
5. Get first hand information from our WhatsApp Community: https://chat.whatsapp.com/BceLhG2GsBL4OWXAqbwVd2
6. Share your progress on social media using **#100DaysOfPython**, and #deeppython

## 🏆 Goals of This Challenge
- Build a **strong coding discipline** and track record.
- Master Python **from core principles to real-world applications**.
- Develop an **AI-powered image recognition project**.
- Open up **sponsorship and financial opportunities**.
