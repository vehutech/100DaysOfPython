 _"Cooking up Computation: From Firewood to a Tech Rookie"_

Welcome to **Day 0** of the **100-Day Python Challenge**! 🚀

Think of today as walking into a kitchen before cooking your first meal. We’re not touching the stove yet—we’re just opening the fridge, looking at the ingredients, and wondering why there's **a floppy disk next to the eggs**. (Weird metaphor? You'll get it soon.)

Computers, like kitchens, have **rules**. If you throw a **raw egg** into a pan, it turns into a delicious omelet. Throw it **into a toaster**, and well... you just ruined breakfast. **Programming is knowing where to put things** so they don’t explode.

Before we start writing Python, let's map out:
- How tech came to be 🍳
    
- How computers think 🧠
    
- Why programmers exist 🤓
    
- The levels of abstraction

- The rise of Python 🐍

## **A Short, Striking History of Tech**

Once upon a time, people **counted on their fingers**. Then someone **invented the abacus** and felt like a genius. Fast forward a few centuries—some really smart people realized they could build machines to do math _faster than humans_.

📌 **1642 – Pascal’s Calculator** 🧮  
A mechanical device for adding and subtracting numbers. Slow, but still better than a human with a chalkboard.

📌 **1837 – Charles Babbage’s Analytical Engine** ⚙️  
A steam-powered _mechanical_ computer that never got built. But hey, his vision laid the foundation for modern computing.

📌 **1936 – Alan Turing’s Universal Machine** 🤖  
The blueprint for all computers. The guy was a genius. Also, fun fact: **he died from eating a cyanide-laced apple**. This is probably why Steve Jobs named his company **Apple**—because the tech industry is nothing if not poetic.

📌 **1950s – First Computers** 🏢  
They were the size of rooms, required an army of engineers, and could barely count past ten before catching fire.

📌 **1970s–1990s – The Software Boom** 💻  
Programming languages evolved from **arcane hieroglyphs (Assembly)** to something _almost readable (C, Java, Python)_.

📌 **2000s–Now – Python Rises** 🐍  
Python became the **language of AI, data science, automation, and web dev**, and now, here we are—learning it **together**.

## **What is a Computer?**

A computer is just a **very expensive rock**—until you give it instructions.
At its core, a computer follows the **IPO Model**:

🔹 **Input** – Data is fed into the system (keyboard, mouse, microphone, sensors).  
🔹 **Process** – The computer manipulates the input using an algorithm.  
🔹 **Output** – The processed data is displayed (screen, printer, speaker).

It’s like cooking:
1. **Input** – You buy ingredients.
    
2. **Process** – You chop, mix, and cook them.
    
3. **Output** – You either get a delicious meal or… burnt regret.

The IPO model is reduced idea behind the true architect of a computer
In the CS50 Introduction to computer science, David described the architecture of computation to be:

Input ---------> Algorithm ---------> Output

Everything here is true except the Algorithm mirrors a shadow of the true picture.
Right in there, we have the Central Processing Unit and the Memory Unit.
The Central Processing Unit which consists of the Control Unit and the Arithmetic Logic Unit

## **Who is a Programmer?**

A **programmer** is just someone who writes **instructions for computers**.

Imagine teaching a **robot chef** how to cook spaghetti:

👩‍🍳 You: _"Boil pasta, add sauce, serve."_  
🤖 Robot: _"What is 'boil'? What is 'pasta'?"_  
👩‍🍳 You: _"…Never mind."_

Computers need **extremely specific instructions**. Even small mistakes can lead to catastrophic results (_hello, NASA’s lost $125M Mars orbiter_).

## **The Art of Programming: What Sorcery Is This?**

Programming is just **telling a computer what to do**.

Sounds simple, right? Except **computers are dumber than a rock**. They only understand **binary (0s and 1s)**, which is like talking to someone who only knows two words:

- **0 = No.**
    
- **1 = Yes.**
    

You: _Hey, can you open Spotify?_  
Computer: _010101000010100000100_  
You: _WTF?_

So, we invented **programming languages** to translate human-friendly ideas into **machine instructions**. The more abstract the language, the easier it is to write.
The hierarchy of these abstraction is known as abstraction levels
## **The Abstraction Levels of Computing**

A computer is made up of **layers**—just like a kitchen:

### **🍽️ Level 5 – High-Level Programming (The Recipe Book)**

Languages like Python, Java, and JavaScript let us write **human-friendly code**.

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

Simple, right? But this **doesn’t run directly on the hardware**—it gets translated downwards.

### **🔥 Level 4 – Low-Level Programming (Cooking the Food)**

Languages like **C and Assembly** are closer to machine code.

Example in Assembly:

```assembly
MOV AL, 61h  
OUT 43h, AL  
```

(_Translation: Make a sound._)

Painful, right? It's like writing a **recipe in binary**.

### **🍳 Level 3 – Operating Systems (The Kitchen Itself)**

Operating systems **manage resources** so we don’t have to think about them. (Windows, macOS, Linux.)

### **🔪 Level 2 – Instruction Set Architecture (The Cooking Utensils)**

This is where **software talks to hardware**. It converts high-level code into **low-level operations**.

### **🧱 Level 1 – Microarchitecture (The Stovetop & Oven)**

The hardware execution of instructions. It ensures that **when we say ‘boil water,’ the stove actually turns on.**

### **⚡ Level 0 – Digital Logic (The Fire That Cooks Everything)**

At the lowest level, everything is just **electricity (1s and 0s).**

## **A Boring-Looking Python Program (Let’s Break It Down)**

```python
def compute(x, y):
    if x > 10 and y < 5:
        for i in range(y):
            x += i
    else:
        while x > 0:
            x -= 2
    return x if x % 2 == 0 else "Odd result"

print(compute(12, 3))
```

At first glance, this code looks like **gibberish**. But let's simplify it:

🔹 **Loops** (`for`, `while`) – Repeat actions multiple times.  
🔹 **Conditions** (`if`, `else`) – Make decisions.  
🔹 **Boolean Logic** (`and`, `or`, `not`) – Connect conditions.  
🔹 **Functions** – Packaged code that we can reuse.  
🔹 **Return Values** – What the function gives back.

## **Why Python?**

Here’s how Python compares to other languages:

| Language   | Strengths                   | Weaknesses                             |
| ---------- | --------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| C          | Fast, powerful              | Hard to read, manual memory management |
| Java       | Cross-platform, OOP         | Verbose, slow startup                  |
| JavaScript | Runs in browsers            | Weird quirks, async complexity         |
| Python 🐍  | Simple, powerful, versatile | Slower than C, indentation matters     |

Python wins because it’s **easy to learn, powerful, and used everywhere**.

## **Programming Paradigms You’ll Master**

A programming paradigm is a theoretical strategy used by programmers to write code. As we know in the real world, there are multiple paths to solving problems. Also there are multiple ways, style, or strategy programmers use in solving problems.

🧱 **Data Abstraction** – Hiding unnecessary details. (Like how you use Google without knowing how its servers work.)

🔒 **Encapsulation** – Keeping data and code together. (Think of a **capsule** protecting its contents.)

🔄 **OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)** – Structuring code like real-world objects. (Classes, objects, inheritance.)

⚡ **Functional Programming** – Treating functions as reusable **mathematical units**.

📦 **Side Effects** – When a function **modifies something outside of itself**. (Dangerous if uncontrolled!)
