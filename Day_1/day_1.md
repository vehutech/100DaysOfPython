Before we dive deep into Python, let‚Äôs take a step back and gather our essentials. Imagine we‚Äôre **preparing a grand feast**‚Äîbefore we start cooking, we need the right ingredients, kitchen tools, and a well-equipped workspace.

From yesterday‚Äôs discussion, we outlined four core things you‚Äôll need:

1. **Dedication**
    
2. **Pen & Notepad**
    
3. **A Device**
    
4. **An IDE**

But there‚Äôs **one more crucial ingredient**:  
5. **Python Interpreter**

Now, let‚Äôs break these down

---

## üèÜ **Dedication ‚Äì The Fire That Cooks the Meal**

Think of **dedication** as the **flame under your cooking pot**. No matter how good your ingredients are, if you don‚Äôt turn on the fire, the food won‚Äôt cook.

This **100-day journey** won‚Äôt always be easy. Some days, you‚Äôll write a bug-free program and feel like a genius. Other days, you‚Äôll spend hours debugging only to realize you forgot a simple comma. The **only thing** that will keep you going is your **commitment to finish what you started**.

Python isn't something you just **read** about‚Äîyou have to **cook, taste, and refine your dishes** every single day. Stay consistent, and by the end of 100 days, you‚Äôll have built something amazing.

---

## üìì **Pen & Notepad ‚Äì Your Recipe Book**

Have you ever watched a **master chef**? They **never rely on memory alone**‚Äîthey write down recipes, tweak ingredients, and note their mistakes for future improvement.

Likewise, your brain won‚Äôt remember everything you learn. A **notepad** (physical or digital) helps you:  
‚úÖ Write down key Python concepts.  
‚úÖ Track your daily progress.  
‚úÖ Record your biggest "Aha!" moments.

> **Pro Tip:** If you prefer digital notes, use **Notion, Evernote, or Google Docs**.

---

## üíª **A Device ‚Äì Your Cooking Pot**

If **Python is the meal**, then your **laptop, PC, or desktop** is the **cooking pot** where everything happens.

Can you cook using a mobile phone? **Technically, yes.** You can learn **basic Python concepts**, but you won‚Äôt be able to:  
‚ùå Build advanced AI models  
‚ùå Develop full-fledged web applications  
‚ùå Handle complex data science projects

That‚Äôs because a **chef needs a proper kitchen** to create gourmet meals. While a phone might help you start, a **computer is the best tool for serious Python development**.

---

## üè° **IDE ‚Äì Your Kitchen**

Your **IDE (Integrated Development Environment)** is the **kitchen** where you cook your Python code.

An IDE provides:  
üç≥ **A workspace** to write and organize your code.  
üî™ **Tools** to debug errors efficiently.  
üå°Ô∏è **A comfortable environment** to make coding easier and more enjoyable.

### **Best Python IDEs:**

1. **üõ†Ô∏è VS Code** ‚Äì Lightweight and flexible.
    
2. **üèóÔ∏è PyCharm** ‚Äì Feature-rich and powerful.
    
3. **üìö Jupyter Notebook** ‚Äì Best for AI, machine learning, and data science.
    

Pick **one**, install it, and **set up your coding kitchen**!
Installation guide coming up shortly.

## üîÑ **Python Interpreter ‚Äì Your Head Chef**

In a restaurant, chefs don‚Äôt serve raw ingredients. They **chop, mix, and cook** before presenting a meal.

Similarly, your **Python code** is just raw instructions. The **Python interpreter** is the **head chef** that translates your code into something the computer understands.

Without the interpreter, a computer looks at this code:

```python
print("I love pizza!")
```

and says, **"What language is this?"** ü§î

But with the interpreter installed, it understands and prints:

```
I love pizza!
```

---

## **Installing the Python Interpreter** ‚Äì The Oven That Cooks Your Code

Without the Python interpreter, your device won‚Äôt understand Python. This is like trying to cook a meal without a stove or oven‚Äîit just won‚Äôt work!

### ‚úÖ **Installing Python on Windows & Mac**

1Ô∏è‚É£ Go to **[https://python.org/downloads](https://python.org/downloads)**  
2Ô∏è‚É£ Click **Download Python 3.13.2** (latest version)

- **Jupyter Notebook** ([Download](https://jupyter.org/install))

---

### üì± **Installing an IDE on a Mobile Device (Android & iOS)**

Since mobile devices don‚Äôt support traditional Python development, we‚Äôll use **cloud-based or mobile-friendly IDEs**.

#### ‚úÖ **Option 1: Pydroid 3 (Android)**

1Ô∏è‚É£ Go to the **Google Play Store**  
2Ô∏è‚É£ Search for **"Pydroid 3 - IDE for Python 3"**  
3Ô∏è‚É£ Click **Install**  
4Ô∏è‚É£ Open the app and start coding!

#### ‚úÖ **Option 2: Pythonista (iOS - Paid)**

1Ô∏è‚É£ Go to the **Apple App Store**  
2Ô∏è‚É£ Search for **"Pythonista 3"**  
3Ô∏è‚É£ Purchase and install the app  
4Ô∏è‚É£ Open the app and start coding!

‚úÖ **Alternative Online IDEs (For Any Device):**

- **Google Colab** (colab.research.google.com)
    
- **Replit** ([replit.com](https://replit.com/))
    

üí° **Analogy:** Think of these mobile IDEs like a **microwave** in your coding kitchen‚Äîconvenient for small tasks, but not ideal for full-course meals!
## **Your First Python Dish: "Hello, Food!"**

Let‚Äôs test our setup by cooking our first Python program. Instead of saying **"Hello, World!"**, let‚Äôs print our **favorite food**:

### **Steps to Create a Python File in PyCharm**

1Ô∏è‚É£ Open PyCharm.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ Click on **"New Project"** ‚Üí Then click **"Create"**.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ In the **top-left menu**, click **"File" ‚Üí "New" ‚Üí "Python File"**.  
4Ô∏è‚É£ Name your file **"main.py"**.

Now, type this inside your Python file:

```python
print("I love cakes!")
```

> Because **who doesn‚Äôt love cakes?** üéÇ

Now, click the **green play button** ‚ñ∂Ô∏è to run the program.

### **Expected Output:**

```
I love cakes!
```

**Congratulations! üéâ You‚Äôve successfully set up Python and written your first program!**

---
## üöÄ **Challenge ‚Äì Print Your Own Info!**

Try writing a Python program that prints:

1. Your **name**
    
2. Your **favorite color**
    
3. Your **favorite food**
    

**Example:**

```python
name = "Alex"
color = "Blue"
food = "Sushi"

print(f"My name is {name}, I love the color {color}, and my favorite food is {food}.")
```

Output:

```python
#My name is Alex, I love the color Blue, and my favorite food is Sushi.
```
## **Comments ‚Äì Your Kitchen Notes üìù**

Just like a chef writes **notes in a cookbook**, programmers use **comments** to make their code understandable.

```python
# This is my first Python program
print("I love cakes!")  
print("I love shopping for new clothes!")  
```

Comments **don‚Äôt affect the program**‚Äîthey‚Äôre just there to help you (or others) understand your code better.

---

## **Variables ‚Äì Your Magical Wand üè∫**

Professionals often describe variables as _containers_, but a more accurate analogy is that they act as _reference points_ rather than physical storage units. Values themselves are stored in memory addresses, and variables simply serve as labels that point to those locations.

Think of it like a **magic wand in a fairy tale**‚Äîa variable doesn't hold the magic itself, but it binds a name to a value, allowing you to summon it whenever needed.

But please let's continue:

Imagine you‚Äôre a chef with a **container labeled "Sugar"**. Whenever you need sugar, you just grab it from that container.

That‚Äôs exactly how **variables work** in Python:

```python
favorite_food = "Pizza"
print(f"You love {favorite_food}")
```

**Output:**

```
You love Pizza
```

---

## **Numbers: Integers & Floats ‚Äì Measuring Ingredients üìè**

In cooking, measurements matter! You don‚Äôt just **pour random amounts of ingredients** into a dish‚Äîyou use **precise values**.

### **Integers (Whole Numbers)**

```python
age = 25
print(f"My age is: {age}")
```

### **Floats (Numbers with Decimals)**

```python
price = 10.99
print(f"The price is: ${price}")
```

---

## **Booleans ‚Äì Yes or No Answers ü§î**

Sometimes, a **chef has to make decisions**:

- **Is the oven hot?** ‚úÖ Yes or ‚ùå No
    
- **Are the ingredients fresh?** ‚úÖ Yes or ‚ùå No
    

In Python, we use **Boolean values (True or False)** for such decisions:

```python
is_student = True
print(f"Are you a student? {is_student}")
```

Output:

```
Are you a student? True
```

> **Note:** Always capitalize `True` and `False` in Python. Writing `true` or `false` will cause an **error**.

---

## **Your First Decision-Making Code: If-Else üçΩÔ∏è**

A restaurant menu might say:

- **If you order pizza, serve pizza.**
    
- **Else, say "Sorry, we only have pizza."**
    

Let‚Äôs write this in Python:

```python
wants_pizza = True

if wants_pizza:
    print("Serving pizza!")  
else:
    print("Sorry, we only serve pizza.")  
```

Try changing `wants_pizza = False` and see what happens!

---

Lets have a rigid look on the exercise we have treated so far:

Ensure to type each code you see in your code editor (IDE), run the code and see the output for yourself.

What makes you a programmer is not reading codes, but writing code with your fingers on the keyboard.

## üéØ **Lesson 1: Printing Text and Numbers**

In Python, we use the `print()` function to display output.

### üìå **Example 1: Printing a Simple Message**

```python
print("I love cakes!")
```

‚úÖ **Output:**

```
I love cakes
```

### üìå **Example 2: Printing Numbers**

```python
print(2025)
print(3.14159)
```

‚úÖ **Output:**

```
2025
3.14159
```

### üìå **Example 3: Printing Multiple Items**

```python
print("I am", 20, "years old")
```

‚úÖ **Output:**

```
I am 20 years old
```

---

## üéØ **Lesson 2: Using Variables**

Variables store information in memory.

### üìå **Example 4: Storing and Printing Variables**

```python
name = "Alice"
age = 25

print("My name is", name)
print("I am", age, "years old")
```

‚úÖ **Output:**

```
My name is Alice
I am 25 years old
```

### üìå **Example 5: Changing Variable Values**

```python
favorite_color = "Blue"
print("My favorite color is", favorite_color)

favorite_color = "Red"
print("Now, my favorite color is", favorite_color)
```

‚úÖ **Output:**

```
My favorite color is Blue
Now, my favorite color is Red
```

---

## üéØ **Lesson 3: Simple Math Operations**

Python can act like a calculator!

### üìå **Example 6: Basic Math**

```python
a = 10
b = 5

print(a + b)  # Addition
print(a - b)  # Subtraction
print(a * b)  # Multiplication
print(a / b)  # Division
```

‚úÖ **Output:**

```
15
5
50
2.0
```

### üìå **Example 7: Power and Modulus**

```python
x = 2 ** 3  # 2 raised to the power of 3
y = 10 % 3  # Remainder of 10 divided by 3

print(x)  # Output: 8
print(y)  # Output: 1
```

---

## üéØ **Lesson 4: String Operations**

### üìå **Example 8: Combining Strings (Concatenation)**

```python
first_name = "John"
last_name = "Doe"

full_name = first_name + " " + last_name
print("Full name:", full_name)
```

‚úÖ **Output:**

```
Full name: John Doe
```

### üìå **Example 9: Repeating Strings**

```python
laugh = "Ha" * 3
print(laugh)
```

‚úÖ **Output:**

```
HaHaHa
```

---

## üéØ **Lesson 5: Getting User Input**

Python can take input from the user using `input()`.

### üìå **Example 10: Asking for User Input**

```python
name = input("What is your name? ")
print("Hello, " + name + "!")
```

‚úÖ **Example Interaction:**

```
What is your name? Alex
Hello, Alex!
```

### üìå **Example 11: Taking Number Input**

```python
num1 = int(input("Enter first number: "))
num2 = int(input("Enter second number: "))

sum_result = num1 + num2
print("The sum is:", sum_result)
```

‚úÖ **Example Interaction:**

```
Enter first number: 7
Enter second number: 3
The sum is: 10
```
