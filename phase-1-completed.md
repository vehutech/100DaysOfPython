🎉🎉🎉 *YOOOOO PYTHONISTASSSS!* 🎉🎉🎉

We just did something INSANE! 

You guys literally just completed PHASE 1 of this 100-day journey and I'm honestly so proud I could cry 😭😅

the long break was a bit refreshing.🫨

months back some of you didn't even know what a variable was...

Now it a flex!!!! 

Writing classes, inheritance, magic methods... like WHAT?! 

You're not playing anymore 🔥

---

OK so here's where we're going with this whole thing:

📍 *PHASE 1: PYTHON CORE (Days 1-29) ✅ DONE!*
This was your foundation. Variables, loops, functions, OOP... all that good stuff

📍 *PHASE 2: DJANGO WEB APPS (Days 30-69)* 🌐
We're about to build actual websites that people can use! Real web apps, databases, user login... the works

📍 *PHASE 3: AI & MACHINE LEARNING (Days 70-100)* 🤖
The grand finale. We're talking AI models, neural networks, making computers think... wild stuff

And yo... I got some NEWS for you guys 📹

I've been locked in doing recorded VIDEO VERSIONS of every single day of this course

From day 1 to present

Every concept, every code example, everything

So you'll have the written modules PLUS video explanations 

Double the learning power!

Still working on it but it's coming together nicely 👌

Real talk though...

Look what you mastered in 29 days:
✅ You can code in Python fluently now
✅ You understand how programs think
✅ You can handle files and data
✅ You write functions like it's nothing  
✅ You know OOP better than most CS graduates
✅ You can debug errors without panicking

That's actually CRAZY progress

---

Tomorrow we start PHASE 2 🚀

We're jumping into web development

HTML, CSS, then straight into Django

By the end of this phase you'll be building full websites

Like... actual web applications that you can show your friends and family

Your portfolio is about to be STACKED

For real though pythonistassss...

I started this course wondering if you guys would stick with it

29 days in and you're all here

Still coding, still learning, still pushing

That's the mindset that separates the real ones from the wannabes

---

Take tonight to celebrate 🥳

You earned it

Tomorrow we dive into how the web actually works

Then we build some crazy stuff together

Phase 2 is going to be different... but you're ready for it

Let's get it! 💪

P.S - Keep watching for updates on those video materials 👀
