# AI Mastery Course - Day 74: Model Evaluation & Validation with Django

## Learning Objective
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to implement comprehensive model evaluation and validation techniques in Django applications, including train/validation/test splits, cross-validation, performance metrics calculation, and ROC curve analysis to ensure your AI models perform reliably in production.

## Imagine That...

Imagine you're the head chef at a prestigious restaurant, and you've just created a revolutionary new recipe for the perfect pasta dish. But here's the catch - you can't just serve it to customers immediately! 

Just like a responsible chef would:
- **Test the recipe** with a small batch first (train/validation split)
- **Have different chefs try it** multiple times to ensure consistency (cross-validation)
- **Measure the results** - taste, presentation, cooking time (performance metrics)
- **Chart the success rate** across different customer preferences (ROC curves)

In the AI kitchen, model evaluation is your quality control system. You're not just cooking up predictions; you're ensuring every "dish" (prediction) that leaves your kitchen meets the highest standards!

## Lesson 1: Train/Validation/Test Splits - The Three-Station Kitchen

### The Chef's Approach
Think of your data like ingredients in a professional kitchen with three stations:
- **Prep Station (Training Data)**: Where you learn the recipe
- **Tasting Station (Validation Data)**: Where you adjust seasoning and technique  
- **Customer Station (Test Data)**: The final judgment - untouched until service

### Django Implementation

```python
# models.py
from django.db import models
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
import joblib

class DataSplitter(models.Model):
    """Model to handle data splitting operations"""
    dataset_name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    train_size = models.FloatField(default=0.7)
    validation_size = models.FloatField(default=0.15)
    test_size = models.FloatField(default=0.15)
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    
    def split_data(self, X, y):
        """
        Split data into train, validation, and test sets
        Like organizing ingredients across three kitchen stations
        """
        # First split: separate test data (the customer station)
        X_temp, X_test, y_temp, y_test = train_test_split(
            X, y, 
            test_size=self.test_size, 
            random_state=42,
            stratify=y  # Ensures balanced distribution like balanced menu
        )
        
        # Second split: separate train and validation (prep and tasting stations)
        val_size_adjusted = self.validation_size / (1 - self.test_size)
        X_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(
            X_temp, y_temp,
            test_size=val_size_adjusted,
            random_state=42,
            stratify=y_temp
        )
        
        return {
            'X_train': X_train, 'y_train': y_train,
            'X_val': X_val, 'y_val': y_val, 
            'X_test': X_test, 'y_test': y_test
        }

# views.py
from django.shortcuts import render
from django.http import JsonResponse
from .models import DataSplitter
import pandas as pd

def split_dataset_view(request):
    """View to handle data splitting requests"""
    if request.method == 'POST':
        # Load your dataset (example with sample data)
        data = pd.read_csv('your_dataset.csv')  # Replace with your data source
        X = data.drop('target', axis=1)  # Features
        y = data['target']  # Target variable
        
        # Create splitter instance
        splitter = DataSplitter.objects.create(
            dataset_name="Customer Preference Dataset",
            train_size=0.7,
            validation_size=0.15,
            test_size=0.15
        )
        
        # Perform the split
        splits = splitter.split_data(X, y)
        
        # Save splits for later use
        for split_name, split_data in splits.items():
            joblib.dump(split_data, f'data/{split_name}.pkl')
        
        return JsonResponse({
            'message': 'Data split successfully!',
            'train_samples': len(splits['X_train']),
            'validation_samples': len(splits['X_val']),
            'test_samples': len(splits['X_test'])
        })
    
    return render(request, 'split_data.html')
```

**Syntax Explanation:**
- `train_test_split()`: Scikit-learn function that randomly divides data
- `stratify=y`: Ensures each split maintains the same proportion of each class (like ensuring each station gets a balanced mix of ingredients)
- `random_state=42`: Sets a seed for reproducible results (like following the same recipe steps every time)

---

## Lesson 2: Cross-Validation Techniques - The Multiple Chef Test

### The Chef's Approach
Imagine you want to test your recipe's consistency. You'd have 5 different experienced chefs each make the dish, rotating who does what. That's exactly what cross-validation does - it tests your model multiple times with different data combinations!

### Django Implementation

```python
# models.py (continued)
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score, StratifiedKFold
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
import numpy as np

class CrossValidator(models.Model):
    """Model to handle cross-validation operations"""
    model_name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    cv_folds = models.IntegerField(default=5)
    cv_scores = models.JSONField(default=list)  # Store cross-validation scores
    mean_score = models.FloatField(null=True, blank=True)
    std_score = models.FloatField(null=True, blank=True)
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    
    def perform_cross_validation(self, X, y, model=None):
        """
        Perform k-fold cross-validation
        Like having multiple chefs test the same recipe
        """
        if model is None:
            model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
        
        # Create stratified k-fold (ensures balanced "chef assignments")
        skf = StratifiedKFold(n_splits=self.cv_folds, shuffle=True, random_state=42)
        
        # Perform cross-validation
        cv_scores = cross_val_score(model, X, y, cv=skf, scoring='accuracy')
        
        # Store results
        self.cv_scores = cv_scores.tolist()
        self.mean_score = np.mean(cv_scores)
        self.std_score = np.std(cv_scores)
        self.save()
        
        return {
            'individual_scores': cv_scores,
            'mean_accuracy': self.mean_score,
            'std_deviation': self.std_score,
            'confidence_interval': (
                self.mean_score - 2*self.std_score, 
                self.mean_score + 2*self.std_score
            )
        }

# views.py (continued)
def cross_validate_model(request):
    """View to perform cross-validation"""
    if request.method == 'POST':
        # Load training data
        X_train = joblib.load('data/X_train.pkl')
        y_train = joblib.load('data/y_train.pkl')
        
        # Create cross-validator
        cv_validator = CrossValidator.objects.create(
            model_name="Random Forest Classifier",
            cv_folds=5
        )
        
        # Perform cross-validation
        results = cv_validator.perform_cross_validation(X_train, y_train)
        
        return JsonResponse({
            'message': 'Cross-validation completed!',
            'results': results,
            'interpretation': f"Your model performs consistently with "
                           f"{results['mean_accuracy']:.3f} Â± {results['std_deviation']:.3f} accuracy"
        })
    
    return render(request, 'cross_validate.html')
```

**Syntax Explanation:**
- `StratifiedKFold`: Ensures each fold maintains class distribution (like ensuring each chef gets the same ingredient proportions)
- `cross_val_score()`: Automatically performs k-fold cross-validation
- `JSONField`: Django field type that stores JSON data (lists, dictionaries) in the database

## Lesson 3: Performance Metrics - The Taste Test Scorecard

### The Chef's Approach
When judging a dish, you don't just say "good" or "bad." You evaluate:
- **Accuracy**: Overall deliciousness (how often you get it right)
- **Precision**: When you say it's perfect, how often is it actually perfect?
- **Recall**: Of all the perfect dishes possible, how many did you identify?
- **F1-Score**: The balanced judgment between precision and recall

### Django Implementation

```python
# models.py (continued)
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, precision_score, recall_score, f1_score
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix

class PerformanceEvaluator(models.Model):
    """Model to calculate and store performance metrics"""
    model_name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    accuracy = models.FloatField(null=True, blank=True)
    precision = models.FloatField(null=True, blank=True)
    recall = models.FloatField(null=True, blank=True)
    f1_score_value = models.FloatField(null=True, blank=True)
    confusion_matrix_data = models.JSONField(default=dict)
    classification_report_data = models.JSONField(default=dict)
    evaluation_date = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    
    def calculate_metrics(self, y_true, y_pred):
        """
        Calculate comprehensive performance metrics
        Like creating a detailed taste test scorecard
        """
        # Basic metrics (the four pillars of evaluation)
        self.accuracy = accuracy_score(y_true, y_pred)
        self.precision = precision_score(y_true, y_pred, average='weighted')
        self.recall = recall_score(y_true, y_pred, average='weighted')
        self.f1_score_value = f1_score(y_true, y_pred, average='weighted')
        
        # Detailed analysis
        self.confusion_matrix_data = confusion_matrix(y_true, y_pred).tolist()
        
        # Classification report (detailed breakdown per class)
        report = classification_report(y_true, y_pred, output_dict=True)
        self.classification_report_data = report
        
        self.save()
        
        return self.get_metrics_summary()
    
    def get_metrics_summary(self):
        """Return a chef-friendly interpretation of metrics"""
        return {
            'accuracy': {
                'value': self.accuracy,
                'interpretation': f"Your model gets it right {self.accuracy:.1%} of the time - like a chef with {self.accuracy:.1%} customer satisfaction!"

            'precision': {
                'value': self.precision,
                'interpretation': f"When your model says 'this is class A', it's correct {self.precision:.1%} of the time - high precision means no false promises!"
            },
            'recall': {
                'value': self.recall,
                'interpretation': f"Your model catches {self.recall:.1%} of all actual instances - high recall means nothing slips through the cracks!"
            },
            'f1_score': {
                'value': self.f1_score_value,
                'interpretation': f"F1-score of {self.f1_score_value:.3f} represents the perfect balance between precision and recall - like balancing flavor and presentation!"
            }
        }

        # Create evaluator and calculate metrics
        evaluator = PerformanceEvaluator.objects.create(
            model_name="Random Forest - Validation Set"
        )

            'confusion_matrix': evaluator.confusion_matrix_data
        })
    
    return render(request, 'evaluate_performance.html')
```

**Syntax Explanation:**
- `average='weighted'`: Calculates metrics for each class and averages them weighted by class frequency
- `output_dict=True`: Returns classification report as a dictionary instead of a string
- `.tolist()`: Converts NumPy arrays to Python lists (JSON-serializable)

## Lesson 4: ROC Curves and AUC - The Master Chef's Rating System

### The Chef's Approach
Imagine you're judging a cooking competition. You need to plot how well each chef performs at different "difficulty thresholds." ROC curves show you exactly that - how your model performs across all possible decision thresholds, like rating dishes from "definitely amazing" to "definitely terrible."

### Django Implementation

```python
# models.py (continued)
from sklearn.metrics import roc_curve, auc, roc_auc_score
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import base64
from io import BytesIO

class ROCAnalyzer(models.Model):

    fpr_data = models.JSONField(default=list)
    tpr_data = models.JSONField(default=list)

    def calculate_roc_auc(self, y_true, y_pred_proba):
        """

        Like creating a master performance chart for a chef
        """
        # Calculate ROC curve points
        fpr, tpr, thresholds = roc_curve(y_true, y_pred_proba)
        
        # Calculate AUC (Area Under the Curve)
        self.auc_score = auc(fpr, tpr)

        plt.plot([0, 1], [0, 1], color='navy', lw=2, linestyle='--', 
                label='Random Guess (AUC = 0.50)')
        plt.xlim([0.0, 1.0])
        plt.ylim([0.0, 1.05])
        plt.xlabel('False Positive Rate (Bad dishes called good)')
        plt.ylabel('True Positive Rate (Good dishes called good)')
        plt.title('ROC Curve - Model Performance Across All Thresholds')
        plt.legend(loc="lower right")
        plt.grid(True, alpha=0.3)

```

**Syntax Explanation:**
- `predict_proba()`: Returns prediction probabilities instead of hard classifications
- `[:, 1]`: Selects the probability of the positive class (column 1)
- `base64.b64encode()`: Converts binary image data to text format for storage/transmission
- `BytesIO()`: Creates an in-memory buffer for temporary file operations

## Assignment: The Master Chef's Challenge

### Your Mission
You are the head chef at "AI Bistro," and you need to evaluate three different "recipe models" (classification algorithms) to determine which one best predicts customer satisfaction with your new fusion menu.

**Dataset**: Use the Wine Quality dataset (available from UCI ML Repository) where you'll predict whether a wine is "high quality" (rating â¥ 7) or not.

**Your Task**:
1. **Data Preparation**: Split the wine dataset using your Django DataSplitter (70% train, 15% validation, 15% test)

2. **Model Training**: Train three different "chef algorithms":
   - Random Forest (the experienced head chef)
   - Logistic Regression (the efficient line cook)  
   - Support Vector Machine (the perfectionist pastry chef)

3. **Cross-Validation**: Use your CrossValidator to test each model's consistency with 5-fold cross-validation

4. **Performance Evaluation**: Calculate accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for each model on the validation set

5. **ROC Analysis**: Generate ROC curves and calculate AUC scores for all three models

6. **Final Recommendation**: Write a "Chef's Report" explaining which model you'd deploy in production and why, using the kitchen analogy throughout.

**Deliverables**:
- Django views that handle each evaluation step
- A comparison table showing all metrics
- ROC curve visualizations for all three models
- A 300-word "Chef's Report" with your final recommendation

**Bonus Challenge**: Create a Django template that displays all results in a beautiful dashboard, as if you're presenting to the restaurant owner!

---

## Final Project: Restaurant Quality Prediction System

Create a complete Django application that helps restaurant owners predict customer satisfaction scores based on various factors (service speed, food quality, ambiance, price, etc.). Your system should:

1. **Data Management**: Handle multiple restaurant datasets with proper train/validation/test splits
2. **Model Pipeline**: Implement automated cross-validation for model selection
3. **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Calculate and display all performance metrics with visual representations
4. **ROC Dashboard**: Interactive ROC curve comparisons between different models
5. **Prediction Interface**: Allow new restaurant data input with confidence intervals
6. **Reporting System**: Generate automated evaluation reports for restaurant managers

This project integrates all concepts learned, creating a production-ready system that any restaurant owner could use to improve their business through data-driven insights!

**Remember**: In the kitchen of machine learning, evaluation isn't just about getting the right answer - it's about understanding how consistently and reliably your model performs across different scenarios. Just like a master chef who tastes, adjusts, and perfects their dishes, a skilled data scientist continuously evaluates and improves their models!
